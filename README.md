# Naruto-Runner
A game inspired by dinosaur game in the chrome, violating any physics rule that I could think of :).

## Pre-Requisties
 - DOSBOX 
 - MASM615 

## Compilation Procedure
 - Move all three files (Trex.asm, Instructions.txt, and data.txt) into [path]\masm615\bin\ directory.
 - Open the dosbox and mount the [path]\masm615\bin directory.
 - Switch to the mounted directory.
 - $: ml trex.asm to compile the program.

## Execution
 - $: trex.exe

**Note: The game may not be playable and laggy. However, the lag can be improved by changing DOSBOX configurations like cpucycles etc. The game in demo is super laggy due to bad configuration of DOSBOX :). Good luck fidning optimal settings for yourself :).**
